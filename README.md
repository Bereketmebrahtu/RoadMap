### An app to help new software developers such as myself navigate the chaotic world of learnig to code.
---
### This app was inspired by my own struggle to find a meaningful and structured roadmap to build up and develop solid understanding of fundamental concepts of programming.
---
### Scattered and unstructured information build up leads to more confusion and most importantly pushes new programmers into giving up. 
---
### With that idea in mind, I am embarking on the journey of building this app armed with the knowledge of Javascript and everything else I learned along the way.
